In the workshop, I would explore free alternatives to using AI into trainee projects. A possible alternative is to use hugging face to make API calls to a model of their choosing. Hugging face offers numerous models for a variety of tasks such as audio classification, computer vision and Natural Language processing. The hugging face API can be used with Python or Node.js. There is a limit to how many calls users can make under the free plan but it is sufficient for trainee projects. The workshop would delve generally into AI and large language models to give trainees a general understanding. The workshop will then look into how to make API calls to hugging face to use the models. It will then go through examples on how to integrate AI into projects. These could range from making chatbots for their website or adding image classification to their projects. RAG implementation could also be explored for those interested.\n\nAdditionally, the workshop could also delve into running LLMs locally for trainee project. LLMs can be run locally for free by downloading models through Ollama. However, it places a heavy burden on the users device.

This workshop’s goal is for trainees to learn working with a shared repository and hence develop projects based on their inspirations and concepts, while collectively working with React.js.

During my role, whilst demonstrating these concepts, I would support their learning process by carefully pointing out their areas of improvement within their homework, assessment and exam preparation. Another experience is my role as a DevSoc training lead since 24T2, where I executed responsibilities such as arranging meetings with my co-lead for our trainee group and assisting trainees with multiple application development concepts during weekly workshops to improve and maintain my teaching and leadership skills. During these arranged meetups, we would use these opportunities to bond and maintain our interactions throughout the semester, as well as work through useful website development concepts and explore different software to assist with our project development goals. I would express my support for my team along with my co-lead to ensure our wellbeing and commitment remain strong throughout the term to achieve our goals. We would also effectively assist and communicate with each other regarding project-related queries or other concerns to further motivate ourselves."),
